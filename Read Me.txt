# OOP Project Setup Guide

This README provides instructions on setting up a Java project in Eclipse named OOP with a package called OOPProject. By following this guide, you'll be able to create the project, set up the package, and import existing Java files to get started with development.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- Eclipse IDE for Java Developers (download from https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 8 or higher)
- The source files for OOPProject ready for import

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Launch Eclipse
1. Open Eclipse IDE on your computer.
2. Choose your desired workspace location (you can use the default or select a custom directory).
3. Click Launch.

### Step 2: Create a New Java Project
1. Navigate to File > New > Java Project.
2. In the Project Name field, enter: OOP
3. Click Finish.

### Step 3: Create a New Package
1. In the Package Explorer, expand the OOP project folder.
2. Right-click on the src folder, select New > Package.
3. Enter the package name: OOPProject
4. Click Finish

### Step 4: Import Existing Java Files
1. Locate the OOPProject folder with your existing `.java` files on your system.
2. Copy the files from your local OOPProject folder.
3. In Eclipse:
   - Go to the Package Explorer.
   - Expand the OOP project, then expand the src folder, and finally the OOPProject package.
   - Right-click on the OOPProject package and select Paste.

   Alternative Import Method:
   1. Right-click on the OOP project in the Package Explorer.
   2. Select Import > General > File System.
   3. Click Next.
   4. Click Browse and navigate to the folder containing your `.java` files.
   5. Select the files you want to import.
   6. Ensure the destination folder is set to `OOP/src/OOPProject`.
   7. Click Finish.

### Step 5: Run Your Project
1. In the Package Explorer, expand the OOPProject package.
2. Locate your main class (the one containing `public static void main(String[] args)`).
3. Right-click on the file and select Run As > Java Application.
